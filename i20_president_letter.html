                <p>Hey there,</p>

                <p>Nerissa and Yichuan reporting in. First off, congratulations on attending Swarthmore College. We’ve all come a long way to get here, and now you are part of us (whether you like it or not :P). Keep in mind how privileged it is to be part of this community, because <a href="http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2008/11/08/obama-denied/">even Obama was rejected from our school</a> -- we are more awesome than him (notice this would be a SAT grammar error), and we know that already.</p>

                <p>Speaking of community, you are now officially a member of of i20, our international student club. As the largest student group on campus, we host a variety of international themed programs (tours, feasts, speaker events, etc.) that are open to all. We hope that you find yourself at home, make friends, and expand your views about culture and identity.</p>

                <p>So, about that time! In few weeks you’ll hop on the plane and begin your new chapter. EXCITED??? NERVOUS??? MIXED FEELINGS??? As much as we look forward to orientation, things might not be as memorable as you’d imagine. The first thing you say to a swattie is probably asking for the wifi password. You’ll have a hard time finding unlabeled buildings, among well-labeled trees and plants. Worse yet, you might find your jet-lagged self leaning against the back corner wall, sleeping through all the free food and fun activities..</p>

                <p>Who knows! The point is, we can’t wait to meet you in person, and we all look forward to getting to know you. To many of us Swatties, a great college experience warrants an inspiring group of people. Surely, the people here will have a meaningful impact on you (intellectually, spiritually, <small><small><small>maybe sexually</small></small></small>), in the same way as you’ll influence them. So, pack your clothes, traveling documents (IMPORTANT), hometown snacks (VERY IMPORTANT), <strike>puppies</strike>, <strike>for-pleasure readings</strike> (trust us, you won’t have time), and get ready to embrace what Obama could not!!</p>

                <p>Welcome to i20, and welcome to Swarthmore.</p>

                <p>Yours,</p>

                <p>Nerissa’19 & Yichuan’20, Co-Presidents of i20</p>
